# springsecurity-with-jwt
Hello,
I have created two projects for configuring Spring Security with the JWT token - 
one project is a simple demo, and the other project is my autorepairs project.

Also, there is a third mini demo project with SpringCloud OpenFeign web client.

For more details about testing them - you can see relevant README.adoc file in the three project folders.
