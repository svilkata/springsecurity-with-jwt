= Autorepairs project - Spring Security configured with JWT

== This is a demo project for autorepairs shop which maintains a database about parts for vehicles.

* You can register a new user
* You can authenticate/log a user
* Spareparts for the moment are filters, rims and tyres. 
  * Anyone can see public all the spareparts
  * Only authenticated users can create new sparepart items, and update them
  * Only authenticated users with admin role has the authority to delete spareparts from the database
* The database comes with initially generated data based on the OPEN-CLOSE principle
* We use a bean exposing the Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder() PasswordEncoder - so passwords are saved in the database encoded, and during password check
* Used in the project MapStruct and ModelMapper


* In order to start testing the project on POSTMAN, you might better look also the documentation of the other project https://github.com/svilkata/springsecurity-with-jwt/tree/master/JWT-SimpleDemo[JWT-SimpleDemo] -
a bearer JWT token should be added as an Authorization header for all authenticated https requests.


* Sample request info (endpoint and body) are given in comments above each controller in the code of the `web` folder.

// TODO: check too many comments / check exceptions (@ControllerAdvice) / check register / check new way


* We save the data in MySQL database using Spring Data and Hibernate
